## Introduction

### Overview of the App
FitSphere is a fitness application designed using React Native, focusing on Android OS. It aims to help users, particularly CSE engineers and chair-oriented workers, maintain a consistent exercise routine to combat health issues arising from a sedentary lifestyle.

### Purpose and Scope
The app promotes regular physical activity, boosts energy and productivity, and supports long-term health by encouraging users to incorporate exercise into their daily routines. FitSphere addresses the common health challenges faced by individuals with sedentary jobs, providing tech-driven solutions to enhance motivation and accessibility to fitness resources.

## Problem Statement

### Identified Issues or Needs Addressed by the App
Many individuals, especially CSE engineers and chair-oriented workers, struggle to maintain a consistent exercise routine, leading to health issues and unwanted pain.

### Target Audience
The app primarily targets CSE engineers and chair-oriented workers, focusing on alleviating health issues from inactivity and promoting a healthier lifestyle.

## Background & Conceptual Framework
The idea for FitSphere originated from the need to address the sedentary lifestyle of CSE students and professionals. The goal was to create an accessible fitness solution tailored to their unique needs. The app is built on the principles of promoting regular physical activity, enhancing productivity through fitness, and supporting long-term health.

## Proposed Design

## Tools Used
- **React Native**: An open-source UI software framework created by Meta Platforms, Inc. It is used to develop applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows, and UWP by enabling developers to use the React framework along with native platform capabilities.

### Local Storage with AsyncStorage
- **Personal settings , workout logs, preferences**: Ensures data persistence and quick access to user-specific data.
- **Interaction with Android OS**: Utilizes Androidâ€™s internal storage, providing unencrypted, asynchronous, persistent key-value storage.
- **AsyncStorage Features**: Asynchronous, non-blocking operations, data persists after app restarts, simple, flexible key-value management.

## Final Deployment
